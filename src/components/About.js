                    <p class="mt-2 text-left">Classic hairstyles are timeless and elegant looks that have been popular for decades. Some examples of classic hairstyles include the bob, the pixie cut, the French twist, and the updo. The bob is a short, chin-length hairstyle that can be worn straight or with curls. The pixie cut is a short, boyish hairstyle that is usually cut close to the head. The French twist is a formal hairstyle in which the hair is twisted and pinned at the back of the head. The updo is a hairstyle in which the hair is styled up and off the shoulders, often with curls or braids. These hairstyles are often seen as elegant and sophisticated, and are a popular choice for special occasions such as weddings and formal events..</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-left">A classic beard style is one that has been around for many years and has proven to be timeless. Some examples of classic beard styles include:

The Full Beard: A full beard is when hair grows on the cheeks, chin, and upper lip. It can be trimmed and shaped to suit the individual's face shape.

The Goatee: A goatee is when hair grows on the chin but is shaved off the cheeks. It can be paired with a mustache for a more complete look.

The sideburns and mustache: This style is when the hair on the cheeks is shaved off and the hair on the sideburns and upper lip is grown out. This style was popular in the 1960s and 1970s.

The Circle Beard: This is a combination of a goatee and a mustache, where the goatee is connected to the mustache creating a circle shape.

The Van Dyke: This style is similar to the goatee, but with a disconnected mustache.

When styling a classic beard, it is important to use quality beard oil or balm to keep it moisturized and to use a beard comb or brush to keep the hair well-groomed. Regular trimming and shaping is also important to maintain the desired shape.</p>
